# DeepPhase
Calculates gravitational wave spectrum from a first-order phase transition using either the Bag model or a specific effective potential

## Dependencies
    matplotlib-cpp (https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp/tree/master)

## Compile
    cd DeepPhase-cpp/build
    make
    ./deepphase

## Notes
    - Bugs still present in GW calculation (not ready for use)
    - Fluid profile & kinetic power spectrum working well!
